# jumptosheetxl README

Have an Excel file with a lot of worksheets?
Tired of cycling through them individually to find the one you're looking for?
Use Jump to Sheet to type a few letters of the worksheet's name and get to it straight away.

HOWE TO USE
1. Download the file ("Jump to Sheet.xlam")
2. Open Excel
3. Go to File > Options > Add-ins
4. In the "Manage" dropdown at the bottom of the window, select "Excel Add-ins" and click "Go"
5. In the "Add-Ins" dialog, click "Browse"
6. Navigate to the folder where you saved the Add-in file, and select the Add-in file
7. Click "OK" to close the "Browse" dialog
8. Add the macro to the Quick Access Toolbar to run it directly from there (it will be in the Macros section under the "Choose commands from" dropdown list)
9. (The macro name is actually "ShowWorksheetList" because I only thought of "Jump to Sheet" when creating this README)
